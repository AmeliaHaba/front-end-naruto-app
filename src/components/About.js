          Naruto is Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
          Kishimoto. The story follows Naruto Uzumaki, a young boy on his ninja
          journey. The story is told in three parts â€“ the first set in Naruto's
          pre-teen years, the second in his teens, and the third following the
          original characters and their children. Along the way he meets some of his
          bestfriends, creates lasting friendships, and fights in intense
          missions. The show is all about believing in yourself and protecting
          your village.
